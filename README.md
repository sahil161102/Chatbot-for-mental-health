# Mental Health chatbot with custom ChatGPT API
This repository hosts the codebase and resources for a mental health focused chatbot built on the ChatGPT API. The chatbot's primary goal is to offer support, information, and resources concerning mental health inquiries. The project prioritizes efficient communication, security, and accuracy as its main pillars. 

This project is in two verticles. in first vertical, I have developed a LSTM-based question answering system on a mental health dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/narendrageek/mental-health-faq-for-chatbot) The features of second verticle is listed below:

Features:
* Employing a prompt-driven engineering approach for faster training and response.
* Utilizing customized prompts to steer interactions, employing shot prompting.
* Enhancing prompts through the Langchain library, integrating pre-trained language models.
* Implementing optimized indexing and search algorithms for quicker and more precise responses.
* Leveraging the Pinecone Vector database for precise data storage and retrieval.
* Conducting accurate Cosine similarity searches between user queries and stored documents.
* Employing OpenAI models like text-embedding-ada-002 for text-to-vector conversion and GPT Turbo 3.5 for natural conversations
